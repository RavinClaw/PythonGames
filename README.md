# Game #001: Lockable
### Description + INFO
Lockable is a game where you play for 20 rounds (editable in the code, look for the line `lockables = 20`) where you click a square to continue to the next round, when you click the square will move to a random area of the game screen. once the game is over it will close after telling you, "Congratulations you won".

### The Idea
This game was based of the idea of how many big titles show hacking to be just clicking on a bunch of squares until a meter fills, some time passes or something
